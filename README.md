# Parking-Garage-Project
Utilizing Object Oriented Programming, I created a Parking Garage program.

This program will ask you if you want to Park, Pay, or Leave. 
If you choose "Park", it will give you a ticket number, and that spot will be taken by you. 
If you choose "Pay", it will pay for your ticket.
If you choose "Leave", it will remove your car from the program, and open up that spot again for the next person using it
